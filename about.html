                </h2>
                <p>
                    SMUCS is the Swansea Metropolitan University Computer Society.                
				</p>
				<p>
					SMUCS is the fastest growing and most active student group at Swansea Metropolitan University.
				</p>
				<p>
					We host entertaining and informative academic events throughout the year, designed to bring the many diverse groups of students together to mix socially and share ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					We aim to aid our members in every subject being taught, as well as a few fascinating extras that may not be on the syllabus.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also host a large variety of social events around Swansea from frantic laser tag and karaoke at the union bar to more sedate, smaller gatherings such as gaming nights and beach parties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our management is entirely voluntary and our members are encouraged to propose new ideas, events, or new directions they feel would benefit to the society, but only if they are prepared to see those ideas through to fruition themselves.
				</p>
